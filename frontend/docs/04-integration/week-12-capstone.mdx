# Week 12: Capstone Project & Future Directions

## Course Synthesis

Over 12 weeks, we've built from embodied AI philosophy to complete autonomous systems. This final week synthesizes the journey and points toward specialization.

## Part 1: Capstone Project

### Example: Warehouse Mobile Manipulator

## Part 3: Research Frontiers

### Unsolved Problems

1. **Generalization**: Robots trained on task A fail on task B. How to build general-purpose robots?

2. **Learning from interactions**: Current approach: collect human data. Future: robots learn by doing (reinforcement learning at scale)

3. **Long-term autonomy**: Robots deploy for months. How to maintain performance with wear, environmental change?

4. **Semantic understanding**: Current SLAM is geometric (where am I?). Need semantic (what is that?).

5. **Safety guarantees**: Formal verification that robot won't cause harm even in unexpected situations.

### Emerging Technologies

- **Transformer models** for robotics: Using large language models for robot task planning
- **Differentiable simulation**: Optimize robot policies using gradient descent through physics simulation
- **Neuromorphic sensors**: Event cameras and spiking neural networks for efficient perception
- **Quantum computing**: Potentially speedup path planning and optimization
- **Continual learning**: Systems that improve over deployment without forgetting prior knowledge

### Design Principles

1. **Start simple**: Program before learning. Decompose into manageable pieces.
2. **Validate early**: Test in simulation, on single tasks, before full integration.
3. **Measure everything**: Metrics quantify progress and identify bottlenecks.
4. **Plan for failure**: Real robots fail. Design recovery, not just prevention.
5. **Iterate rapidly**: Deploy, measure, improve, repeat.

## Final Thoughts

Robotics is at an inflection point. Progress in AI (especially large language models), cheaper hardware, and better simulation has made it feasible for small teams to build sophisticated systems.

The fundamentals you've learned—embodied AI, perception, planning, control, learning—are timeless. Technologies change (Python replaces C++, GPT-4 replaces previous models), but the core concepts persist.

**Your next steps**:
1. Pick a real robot (Boston Dynamics Spot, UR manipulator, mobile base)
2. Implement one component deeply (e.g., SLAM, manipulation pipeline)
3. Contribute to open-source robotics projects
4. Join a robotics team or lab
5. Specialize in a domain that excites you

The field needs diverse talent: engineers building systems, researchers pushing theory, entrepreneurs commercializing, educators training the next generation.

Welcome to embodied AI. The future is physical.
